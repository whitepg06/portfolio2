    <h2>AWS DevOps</h2>
    <p>In this project I created a shell script that automatically provisons an AWS EC2 Ubuntu instance as a LAMP server with various programming languages and tools. In addition, there is a second script that adds on support for a Remote Desktop accessible GUI server. This is what I often use for software development as it can be accessed anywhere from any computer.</p>

<h2>JSP Pizza</h2>
    <p>Using Java Servlet Pages to code, in class we made a program webpage that allows a customer to order a pizza, choose toppings for that said pizza, and receive a ordered taken notification. Uses basic Java script code that comprises the code altogether. This was done under the instruction of Professor John Phillips at Mansfield University of Pennsylvania

<h2>Happy Day</h2>
    <p>Happy Day is an application a group comprised of myself and colleagues created in college at Mansfield University. It is a social media website that prides on the blocking of negative energy. Our goal is to filter out specific words to prevent cyber bullying and social shaming. Happy Day is an application designed to filter out certain words and context based off of its overall happiness. This application's goal is to prevent cyber bullying across social media platforms. Any words seen as 'unhappy' in our database will return a null value not allowing that content to be posted as a result.

<h2>Java Game of Life</h2>
    <p>Java Game of Life is a random color generating that generates colors in various different cells. The user may select the color they want the cells to appear whether they would like the cells black and white, or colorful. Other settings the user can use on this program is add further code to make the program to have a more extensive outcome such as using mathematical equations to generalize a population based off of the random color generator, giving each cell the value of a person. </p>

 <h2>Team Project Application</h2>
    <p>This project consists of a console-based menu-driven application to keep track of employees at a large company. The software is written in Java and the data is stored in a MySQL database table. We used the Scrum Method to complete the project. Each week a new scrum master was assigned to lead the team. Alongside that Trello helped as a good basis for keeping track of assignments and objectives. Overall, the project allowed us to work better in a group opposed to alone.</p>
